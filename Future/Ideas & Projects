- Simple snake game for my niece to play.
- Parent app for tracking chores and allowance.
- File Manager
- Simple app to remind you to take your meds.
- Book searching website (find at your local library or bookstore)
- Crystal website <!-- (Take a quiz & find out which type of crystals work for you. then get sent to places that sell those crystals). -->

Big Leaps
- Creating an API or a way that you get more varied results on pinterest instead of just white folks when you search anything.
